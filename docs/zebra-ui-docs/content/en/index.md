### Introduction

[zebra-ui](https://zebraui.com/) is a mobile component library developed based on uniapp, aiming to achieve unified code style and page interaction across multiple platforms.

The component library is written using `vue3`, `ts`, and `Composition API`.

While ensuring multi-platform compatibility, zebra-ui enables developers to write more standardized and rigorous code in scenarios where large projects need to be maintained by multiple people for a long time, and at the same time, improve the overall development efficiency of the team.

- 🔨 Compatible with multiple platforms, achieving consistent style when developing across multiple platforms.
- 🎨 Customizable themes, with over 90% usable style variables for each component.
- 🎨 Supports dark mode, with dark mode adaptation provided in the example project.
- ⚡️ Developed using the mainstream approach of `vue3`, `ts`, and `setup`.
